title: Configuration
description: Server configuration keys reference documentation.
---

This page describes methods for configuring QuestDB server settings.
Configuration can be set either:

- In the `server.conf` configuration file available in the
  [root directory](/docs/concept/root-directory-structure/)
- Using environment variables

When a key is absent from both the configuration file and the environment
variables, the default value is used. Configuration of logging is handled
separately and details of configuring this behavior can be found at the
[logging section](#logging) below.

## Environment variables

All settings in the configuration file can be set or overridden using
environment variables. If a key is set in both the `server.conf` file and via an
environment variable, the environment variable will take precedence and the
value in the server configuration file will be ignored.

To make these configuration settings available to QuestDB via environment
variables, they must be in the following format:

```shell
QDB_<KEY_OF_THE_PROPERTY>
```

Where `<KEY_OF_THE_PROPERTY>` is equal to the configuration key name. To
properly format a `server.conf` key as an environment variable it must have:

1. `QDB_` prefix
2. uppercase characters
3. all `.` period characters replaced with `_` underscore

For example, the server configuration key for shared workers must be passed as
described below:

| `server.conf` key     | env var                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `shared.worker.count` | `QDB_SHARED_WORKER_COUNT` |

:::note

QuestDB applies these configuration changes on startup and a running instance
must be restarted in order for configuration changes to take effect

:::

### Examples

The following configuration property customizes the number of worker threads
shared across the application:

```shell title="conf/server.conf"
shared.worker.count=5
```

```shell title="Customizing the worker count via environment variable"
export QDB_SHARED_WORKER_COUNT=5
```

## Docker

This section describes how configure QuestDB server settings when running
QuestDB in a Docker container. A command to run QuestDB via Docker with default
interfaces is as follows:

```shell
docker run -p 9000:9000 \
 -p 9009:9009 \
 -p 8812:8812 \
 -p 9003:9003 \
 questdb/questdb
```

This publishes the following ports:

- `-p 9000:9000` - [REST API](/docs/reference/api/rest/) and
  [Web Console](/docs/reference/web-console/)
- `-p 9009:9009` - [InfluxDB line protocol](/docs/reference/api/influxdb/)
- `-p 8812:8812` - [Postgres wire protocol](/docs/reference/api/postgres/)
- `-p 9003:9003` -
  [Min health server and Prometheus metrics](#minimal-http-server)

The examples in this section change the default HTTP and REST API port from
`9000` to `4000` for illustrative purposes, and demonstrate how to publish this
port with a non-default property.

### Environment variables

Server configuration can be passed to QuestDB running in Docker by using the
`-e` flag to pass an environment variable to a container:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 -e QDB_HTTP_BIND_TO=0.0.0.0:4000 questdb/questdb
```

### Mounting a volume

A server configuration file can be provided by mounting a local directory in a
QuestDB container. Given the following configuration file which overrides the
default HTTP bind property:

```shell title="./server.conf"
http.bind.to=0.0.0.0:4000
```

Running the container with the `-v` flag allows for mounting the current
directory to QuestDB's `conf` directory in the container. With the server
configuration above, HTTP ports for the web console and REST API will be
available on `localhost:4000`:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/root/.questdb/conf" -p 4000:4000 questdb/questdb
```

To mount the full root directory of QuestDB when running in a Docker container,
provide a the configuration in a `conf` directory:

```shell title="./conf/server.conf"
http.bind.to=0.0.0.0:4000
```

Mount the current directory using the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/root/.questdb/" -p 4000:4000 questdb/questdb
```

The current directory will then have data persisted to disk:

```bash title="Current directory contents"
├── conf
│  └── server.conf
├── db
└── public
```

## Keys and default values

This section lists the configuration keys available to QuestDB by topic or
subsystem. Parameters for specifying buffer and memory page sizes are provided
in the format `n<unit>`, where `<unit>` can be one of the following:

- `m` for **MB**
- `k` for **kB**

For example:

```bash
# Setting maximum send buffer size to 2MB per TCP socket
http.net.connection.sndbuf=2m
```

### Shared worker

Shared worker threads service SQL execution subsystems and (in the default
configuration) every other subsystem.

| Property                  | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

| shared.worker.count       | 2       | Number of worker threads shared across the application. Increasing this number will increase parallelism in the application at the expense of CPU resources. |
| shared.worker.affinity    |         | Comma-delimited list of CPU ids, one per thread specified in `shared.worker.count`. By default, threads have no CPU affinity.                                |
| shared.worker.haltOnError | false   | Toggle whether worker should stop on error.                                                                                                                  |

#### Load balancing

This section describes configuration settings for the distribution of work by
writer threads in a QuestDB instance.

| Property                          | Default | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cairo.max.uncommitted.rows        | 500000  | Maximum number of uncommitted rows per table, when the number of pending rows exceeds this parameter on a table, a commit will be issued. |
| line.tcp.commit.timeout           | 1000    | Pending rows will be committed after `line.tcp.commit.timeout` milliseconds inactivity on each table.                                     |
| line.tcp.maintenance.job.interval | 30000   | Maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) between maintenance jobs, these will commit any uncommitted data on inactive tables.             |

### Minimal HTTP server

This server runs embedded in a QuestDB instance by default and enables health
checks of an instance via HTTP. It responds to all requests with a HTTP status
code of `200` unless the QuestDB process dies.

:::info

Port `9003` also provides a `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus metrics exposed.
Examples of how to use the min server and Prometheus endpoint can be found on
the [health monitoring page](/docs/operations/health-monitoring/).

### Telemetry

QuestDB sends anonymous telemetry data with information about usage which helps
us improve the product over time. We do not collect any personally-identifying
information, and we do not share any of this data with third parties.

| Property          | Default | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| telemetry.enabled | true    | Enable or disable anonymous usage metrics collection. |

## Logging

The logging behavior of QuestDB may be set in dedicated configuration files or
by environment variables. This section describes how to configure logging using
these methods.

### Configuration file

Logs may be configured via a dedicated configuration file `log-stdout.conf`.

```shell title="log-stdout.conf"
# list of configured writers
writers=file,stdout

# file writer
#w.file.class=io.questdb.log.LogFileWriter
#w.file.location=questdb-debug.log
#w.file.level=INFO,ERROR

# stdout
w.stdout.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter
w.stdout.level=INFO,ERROR
```

QuestDB will look for `/log-stdout.conf` on the classpath unless this name is
overridden via a "system" property: `-Dout=/something_else.conf`.

### Environment variables

Values in the log configuration file can be overridden with environment
variables. All configuration keys must be formatted as described in the
[environment variables](#environment-variables) section above.

For example, to set logging on `ERROR` level only:

```shell title="Setting log level to ERROR in log-stdout.conf"
w.stdout.level=ERROR
```

This can be passed as an environment variable as follows:

```shell title="Setting log level to ERROR via environment variable"
export QDB_LOG_W_STDOUT_LEVEL=ERROR
```

### Configuring Docker logging

When mounting a volume to a Docker container, a logging configuration file may
be provided in the container located at `./conf/log.conf`. For example, a file
with the following contents can be created:

```shell title="./conf/log.conf"
# list of configured writers
writers=file,stdout,http.min

# file writer
w.file.class=io.questdb.log.LogFileWriter
w.file.location=questdb-docker.log
w.file.level=INFO,ERROR,DEBUG

# stdout
w.stdout.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter
w.stdout.level=INFO

# min http server, used monitoring
w.http.min.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter
w.http.min.level=ERROR
w.http.min.scope=http-min-server
```

The current directory can be mounted:

```shell title="Mount the current directory to a QuestDB container"
docker run -p 9000:9000 -v "$(pwd):/root/.questdb/" questdb/questdb
```

The container logs will be written to disk using the logging level and file name
provided in the `./conf/log.conf` file, in this case in `./questdb-docker.log`.

### Prometheus Alertmanager

QuestDB includes a log writer that sends any message logged at critical level
(logger.critical("may-day")) to Prometheus Alertmanager over a TCP/IP socket.
Details for configuring this can be found in the
[Prometheus documentation](/docs/third-party-tools/prometheus/).

To configure this writer, add it to the `writers` config alongside other log
writers.

```bash title="log.conf"
# Which writers to enable
writers=stdout,alert

# stdout
w.stdout.class=io.questdb.log.LogConsoleWriter
w.stdout.level=INFO

# Prometheus Alerting
w.alert.class=io.questdb.log.LogAlertSocketWriter
w.alert.level=CRITICAL
w.alert.location=/alert-manager-tpt.json
w.alert.alertTargets=localhost:9093,localhost:9096,otherhost:9093
w.alert.defaultAlertHost=localhost
w.alert.defaultAlertPort=9093

# The `inBufferSize` and `outBufferSize` properties are the size in bytes for the
# socket write buffers.
w.alert.inBufferSize=2M
w.alert.outBufferSize=4M
# Delay in milliseconds between two consecutive attempts to alert when
# there is only one target configured
w.alert.reconnectDelay=250
```

Of all properties, only `w.alert.class` and `w.alert.level` are required, the
rest assume default values as stated above (except for `w.alert.alertTargets`
which is empty by default).

Alert targets are specified using `w.alert.alertTargets` as a comma-separated
list of up to 12 `host:port` TCP/IP addresses. Specifying a port is optional and
defaults to the value of `defaultAlertHost`. One of these alert managers is
picked at random when QuestDB starts, and a connection is created.

All alerts will be sent to the chosen server unless it becomes unavailable. If
it is unavailable, the next server is chosen. If there is only one server
configured and a fail-over cannot occur, a delay of 250 milliseconds is added
between send attempts.

The `w.alert.location` property refers to the path (absolute, otherwise relative
to `-d database-root`) of a template file. By default, it is a resource file
which contains:

```json title="/alert-manager-tpt.json"
[
  {
    "Status": "firing",
    "Labels": {
      "alertname": "QuestDbInstanceLogs",
      "service": "QuestDB",
      "category": "application-logs",
      "severity": "critical",
      "version": "${QDB_VERSION}",
      "cluster": "${CLUSTER_NAME}",
      "orgid": "${ORGID}",
      "namespace": "${NAMESPACE}",
      "instance": "${INSTANCE_NAME}",
      "alertTimestamp": "${date: yyyy/MM/ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS}"
    },
    "Annotations": {
      "description": "ERROR/cl:${CLUSTER_NAME}/org:${ORGID}/ns:${NAMESPACE}/db:${INSTANCE_NAME}",
      "message": "${ALERT_MESSAGE}"
    }
  }
]
```

Four environment variables can be defined, and referred to with the
`${VAR_NAME}` syntax:

- _ORGID_
- _NAMESPACE_
- _CLUSTER_NAME_
- _INSTANCE_NAME_

Their default value is `GLOBAL`, they mean nothing outside a cloud environment.

In addition, `ALERT_MESSAGE` is a placeholder for the actual `critical` message
being sent, and `QDB_VERSION` is the runtime version of the QuestDB instance
sending the alert. The `${date: <format>}` syntax can be used to produce a
timestamp at the time of sending the alert.

### Debug

QuestDB logging can be quickly forced globally to `DEBUG` via either providing
the java option `-Debug` or setting the environment variable `QDB_DEBUG=true`.
